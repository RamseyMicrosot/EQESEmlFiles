Dear [Your Name],

Congratulations! Our records indicate that you've been exclusively selected to receive a sum of $10,000,000 from the estate of a late wealthy benefactor. We have been trying to reach you urgently.

Please treat this with utmost confidentiality. Your prompt response is necessary to ensure that the funds are transferred to you without delay.

To claim your inheritance:

1. **Send us your details:** Full name, date of birth, address, and bank details.
2. **Pay a minor fee:** Only $199.99 for the processing and handling of your inheritance. 
3. **Wait for confirmation:** Once we have processed your information, you will receive confirmation of your windfall within hours!

But act FAST! If we don't hear from you in the next 24 hours, the inheritance will be transferred to another beneficiary.

This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, [Your Name]. Don't miss out on changing your life forever.

Blessings,
Dr. Michael A. Prince
Senior Wealth Transfer Agent
