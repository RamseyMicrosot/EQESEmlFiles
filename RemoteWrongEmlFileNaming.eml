Hi [Your Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss our scheduled meeting for next Tuesday at 3 PM. Due to a prior commitment that just surfaced on my calendar, I was wondering if we could possibly reschedule.

Would Wednesday at the same time work for you? If not, please let me know a few alternatives, and I'll do my best to accommodate.

Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, and thank you for understanding.

Best regards,
Alicia Martin
