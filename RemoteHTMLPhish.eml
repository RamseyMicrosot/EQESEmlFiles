    NOTE: This is a fictional example of a phishing email. In reality, always be cautious of emails from financial institutions or any other organizations that ask you to click on a link to log in or verify account details. When in doubt, contact the institution directly through trusted methods (e.g., their official website or phone number) rather than clicking on email links.
